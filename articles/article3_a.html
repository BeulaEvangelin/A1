            <h3>Authors: Lucas Walsh and Joanne Gleeson</h3>
            <p>As we pass the half way mark in term 3, many students in Year 12 will be thinking more and more about their future.

                Universities and TAFEs are having open days and no doubt, teachers, friends and family will be asking, “what are you going to do next year?”
                
                As educators, parents and carers, we know these are difficult questions. But if anything, they are becoming more difficult for young people in an unpredictable and competitive job market
                
                Our research shows young people are uncertain and worried about next steps after school. So we have also developed a questionnaire to help parents and teachers talk to school leavers and understand their thoughts and feelings about careers and life after school.</p>
